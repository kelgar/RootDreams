text = "Two weeks have passed now... after a lot of hard work the well is finished and progress on the house is good, since the hard rock I gained from constructing the well is perfectly suited for the walls of the house. Down there I also found a good place for the runic stone - safe from any outside influences.^n^n I should really build some safety measures to protect it. After all the power of the forest spirit makes the plants grow, lets the spring produce fresh water and enables me to finally do proper research!"
